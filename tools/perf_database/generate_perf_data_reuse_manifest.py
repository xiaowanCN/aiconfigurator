Generate the runtime manifest that controls cross-backend perf-data reuse.

For every (system, op_file, kernel_source) triple, compute:
  - which (framework, version) pairs contributed rows
  - how many shape keys overlap between frameworks
  - latency divergence stats across overlapping shapes
  - within-framework cross-version row duplication (dedup target)

Tier classification:
  - `shared`           : kernel_source is a non-empty named kernel
                         (not "default")
  - `shared_fallback`  : kernel_source == "default" (framework-implicit,
                         low-fidelity placeholder)

Rows whose kernel_source is blank/`<unknown>` are skipped during the scan (and
logged) — they have no name to key inheritance on, and the current corpus has
zero such rows.

The latency metric is resolved per table from `_LATENCY_COLUMN_GROUPS`. Tables
that split latency across component columns (the DeepEP dispatch/combine
tables) have their components summed the same way the SDK sums them at load
time, so a composed metric is comparable with a single-column one.

The script emits three artifacts:
  - JSON of per-group raw stats
  - Markdown report table
  - YAML manifest consumed by the compiled engine source resolver

Usage:
    python3 tools/perf_database/generate_perf_data_reuse_manifest.py \\
        --data-root aic-core/src/aiconfigurator_core/systems/data \\
        --out-json $TMPDIR/perf-data-reuse-analysis.json \\
        --out-md   docs/perf_database/perf-data-reuse-analysis.md \\
        --out-manifest aic-core/src/aiconfigurator_core/systems/perf_data_reuse_manifest.yaml

The manifest lives under aic-core/src/aiconfigurator_core/systems/ so the
compiled source resolver
(aic-core/rust/aiconfigurator-core/src/perf_database/source_resolution.rs)
reads it as package data and decides, per (op_file, kernel_source), which
sibling backend/version directories the active backend may inherit from. No
perf data is moved or rewritten on disk.

# How to derive a comparable latency metric from a perf table's header.
#
# Most tables carry a single latency-like column. A few carry the metric split
# across component columns and are only meaningful when summed — the SDK does
# exactly that when it loads them, so the scan must match or it would compare
# a fragment of the latency against another table's whole.
#
# Each entry is the tuple of columns to sum; the first entry whose columns are
# all present in the header wins. Single-column entries come first so tables
# with a plain `latency`/`avg_ms` column keep their historical metric.

# backend's rows silently reroutes the SDK onto the wrong kernel.
#
# The one known family (kda, review 2026-08-04): the sglang K3 fused-decode
# routing selects `kda_fused_decode` for a shard exactly when that shard has
# NO Triton-pair generation key — "The SDK's per-key fused routing requires
# the Triton key to be ABSENT for the covered shard" (b200_sxm kda sglang
# collection_meta.yaml). vLLM genuinely collects rows under the same physical
# kernel names, so a multi-framework `shared` entry lets the cross-backend
# channel fill the absent sglang keys and defeat the reroute — measured
# regression: b300 K3 agg spec bs1 tpot 3.296 -> 3.336 ms (Triton-pair
# pricing replacing the measured fused kernel). The verify-phase
# fold-to-zero for `causal_conv1d_update` is absence-dependent the same way
# (a donor verify row un-folds the conv cost that the fused verify row
# already contains).
#
# GDN was audited and left inheritable: its only `model_key not in by_key`
# sites are nearest-shard fallbacks, not reroutes — no GDN routing decision
# keys on absence.
#
# Entries listed here are emitted with tier `absence_load_bearing`: still
# visible in the manifest with their stats, but outside the runtime resolver's
# {shared, shared_fallback} admission, so they never join a cross-backend
# kernel_source filter.
#
# GRADUATION CRITERION (owner decision 2026-08-04): this denylist is a
# one-off. If a SECOND absence-dependent kernel family appears, do not
# extend the list — promote the SDK to a primary-only routing view instead
