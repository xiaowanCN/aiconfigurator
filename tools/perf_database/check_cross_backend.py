Multi-reference sanity checks of perf-database perf tables.

Different backends legitimately differ — this tool does NOT demand
consistency. It flags SUSPICIOUS measurements by checking each table against
several independent reference frames (sibling backends' local baseline,
sibling systems, the curve's own neighboring shapes, physical speed-of-light
bounds) and asks a human to double-check them; nothing is blocked by default.

For every (system, op_file) present in >= 2 backends, join the latest version
of each backend on the shape key and emit findings on two layers:

  Layer 1 — ANOMALY (data-validity, actionable):
    - `nonpositive_latency`: rows whose latency is <= 0 — a classic collector
                           corruption mode (timer failure, unit bug). Counted
                           per (backend, kernel_source) and excluded from the
                           statistical checks below. Tables whose latency is a
                           difference/calibration value (see
                           _DELTA_LATENCY_OP_FILES) are exempt.
    - `pair_outlier`     : a shape point whose cross-backend latency ratio
                           deviates from its *local baseline* by more than
                           --anomaly-factor (default 3x). The baseline is
                           hierarchical — shape bucket, then series (non-sweep
                           shape columns), then op-level median — so
                           legitimate shape-dependent framework gaps are
                           absorbed and what's left is likely a bad
                           measurement in one of the two tables. A single
                           pair cannot tell WHICH side is bad (one side too
                           slow and the other too fast look identical), so
                           each outlier names both sides as candidates and
                           attribution is decided by corroboration: a side
                           that deviates against >= 2 distinct reference
                           backends is reported as the likely suspect.
    - `region_deviation` : a whole shape bucket whose median ratio deviates
                           from the op-level median by more than the anomaly
                           factor. Not a stray point — a whole region of the
                           joined table deviates from how these two backends
                           normally compare (bad sweep, degenerate kernel
                           path, wrong unit).
    - `mono_violation`   : within one backend, latency drops by more than
                           (1 - --mono-tolerance) while a sweep dimension
                           (batch_size / isl / m / step) grows with all other
                           shape columns fixed. Points below --noise-floor
                           latency are exempt (timer noise regime; the floor
                           is auto-scaled for microsecond-unit tables).
    - `spike_violation`  : within one backend, a point higher than BOTH sweep
                           neighbors by more than --spike-factor — a bad
                           measurement (jitter, preemption, missing warmup)
                           needing no reference framework.
    - `below_sol`        : gemm latency below the speed-of-light bound
                           computed from the system's gpu spec (peak flops /
                           HBM bandwidth; the bandwidth term only applies to
                           working sets beyond L2 hot-cache reach).
                           Physically impossible — definitive without any
                           reference framework.
    - `machine_op_deviation`: hint (not gated) — a (system, backend, op)
                           whose latency level is off relative to how that
                           system compares to its peers on its other ops
                           (hardware factor removed); points at a
                           collection-environment problem on that machine.

  Layer 2 — GAP (framework-difference, informational):
    - `systematic_offset`: a backend pair whose op-level median ratio deviates
      beyond --offset-factor (default 1.15x) in the SAME direction on every
      covered system (>= --min-offset-systems). A shape-local kernel weakness
      moves with shape and hardware; a uniform multiplier reproduced across
      systems is the fingerprint of a framework-level collection or
      configuration difference (eager mode, missing torch.compile, disabled
      CUDA graphs) rather than of the shapes.
    - per-pair summaries: joined points, median/p05/p95 ratio, and both
      sides' kernel_source lists (e.g. fa3 vs flash_attention vs triton) so
      implementation differences are distinguishable from bad data.
    - `kernel_choice_cost`: within one framework's table, kernels measured on
      the same shapes as a faster alternative — the price of that backend
      selection.
    - attribution: offsets and suspects are labeled `kernel_choice` (the two
      sides run different kernel families, normalized via
      collector/kernel_source_backends.yaml) or `harness_config` (same kernel
      family — the gap comes from the wrapper/config around it).

Backend pairs whose latest tables disagree on shape columns are NOT force-
joined: extra columns that are constant in their table are dropped (recorded
in the pair-summary align_notes); otherwise the pair is skipped and reported as `schema_mismatch`.

Shape-key convention follows perf_data_layout.py: every column that is not
a meta column ({framework, version, device, op_name, kernel_source}) and not
a latency column is part of the shape key. Sweep columns get log2-bucketed to
form the local-baseline bucket key.
