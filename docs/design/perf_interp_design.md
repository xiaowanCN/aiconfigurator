# perf_interp — the unified perf-table interpolation engine

Status: HISTORICAL — superseded by #1357 PR-5 (single-oracle). The
`sdk/perf_interp/` package this document describes was retired; its role
(per-op interpolation, SOL rooflines, `util_empirical` estimation) is served
by the compiled Rust engine (`aic-core/rust/aiconfigurator-core`:
`perf_database/*.rs`, `operators/*.rs`, `operators/util_empirical.rs`).
Kept for the design rationale and the leave-one-out accuracy evidence that
still anchor the Rust implementation. Originally shipped with PR #1303.

## 1. Problem

Every op in the SDK (GEMM, attention, MLA, DSA/CSA, MoE, Mamba, comm, ...)
answers SILICON queries from a collected perf table: a nested dict
`data[x][y]...[axis_n] -> {latency, power, energy}`. Three realities shaped
the old code and motivated the redesign:

1. **Tables are ragged, not Cartesian.** Real collection is corner-truncated
   (large seq x large batch is skipped for cost/OOM: attention sub-grids are
   ~75% filled with a staircase frontier), and GEMM's `(n, k)` are *scattered
   real matmul shapes* — a dense m-sweep collected at one model's `(n, k)`
   forms no product with any other shape (the reverse `(k, n)` usually does
   not exist).
2. **Queries extrapolate.** Deployments ask for token counts, sequence
   lengths and batch sizes beyond what was benched.
3. **Physics is known per op.** Every op has an analytic speed-of-light
   `SOL(coords) = max(compute, memory)` roofline, and its utilization
   `util = SOL/latency` is a smooth, bounded quantity.

The legacy answer was *load-time grid pre-expansion*
(`extrapolate_data_grid`): densify every table into a rectangle at load, so
query-time interpolation only ever saw complete grids. That decision is the
root of most of the defensive code catalogued in section 5: rectangularizing
scattered shapes mangles them, the synthesized points polluted lookups
(forcing raw-vs-expanded double bookkeeping), and axis-by-axis expansion
produced order-dependent interpolation-of-interpolation.

## 2. Design

One shared N-axis resolver (`sdk/perf_interp/engine.py`) driven by a
declarative per-op record (`sdk/perf_interp/config.py`). Adding an op is
adding a config, not a code path.

### Resolution chain (the whole engine in four steps)

```
1. exact hit             -> return the measured leaf verbatim
2. resolve in the data   -> Grid: nested bracket+blend (value-transform space)
                            ScatteredSites: site curve eval; unknown site ->
                            nearest-site transfer in util space
3. beyond the range      -> hold the boundary util (k_tail-median anchor),
                            latency = SOL(query) / util
4. nothing to anchor on  -> raise (structured miss; never fabricate)
```

### Two resolvers — the only two table shapes that exist

| Resolver | Table shape | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `ScatteredSites(site_axes, curve_axis)` | GEMM: scattered `(n,k)` sites, each owning an m-curve | exact site answers from its **own** curve; an uncollected shape borrows **util** from the nearest collected shapes (log-space IDW, filtered to sites whose curve covers the query m, 2.0-octave miss gate). The gate is **waived along exactly one overflowing axis** for a query beyond the collected frontier in the scale-up direction (issue #1415, big-vocab LM heads: `n = vocab/tp` past every collected `n`): admissibility is computed over the coverage-eligible candidates — the query must exceed their maximum on exactly one axis, sit at/above their minimum on every axis, and still pass the 2.0-octave gate on the remaining axes; the admissible frontier sites anchor the ordinary IDW util transfer and `SOL(query)` carries the growth. Interior holes, scale-down / mixed-direction queries, and simultaneous multi-axis overflow (a sparse stub table, e.g. an `fp8_block` table collected only at `n,k<=128`) keep the miss. |
| `Grid()` | everything else, 1..N axes | per level: exact key collapses; otherwise bracket + blend; a ragged branch is dropped -- and when only one branch survives, its value is **SOL-ratio-corrected along the dropped axis** (util held), never clamped; past the staircase frontier = ordinary out-of-range util-hold |

The engine is N-axis: context DSA/CSA carries a past-KV axis
(`[heads][prefix][seq][batch]`), and the same op can be 4-axis in new
collections but 3-axis in legacy files — the shape is detected **per
(quant, arch, backend) slice at query time**, never assumed globally.

### Invariants (deliberately not knobs)

- **Measured points are returned exactly.** The engine never smooths
  collected data — GEMM-m wave-quantization sawteeth survive iff collected,
  which is the collector's job, not the interpolator's.
- **Cross-site transfer and extrapolation are always in util space.** A
  neighbouring shape's *latency* means nothing at the query shape, but its
  *efficiency* transfers, and `SOL(query)` re-applies the exact scaling.
  Extrapolation is unbounded by design: outside the data, held efficiency +
  analytic SOL is the only honest signal at any distance.
- **Energy rides as average power** (`energy/latency`, smooth and bounded),
  blended with the same weights, then re-multiplied.

### The one knob: per-axis value transform

`value_transform` (`raw | sqrt | util`) is the space used for interpolation
*between* measured points, and it applies **per axis** (`transform_axis`) —
curvature is a property of the axis, not the table. Context-type attention is
~seq^2 along seq but ~linear along batch/heads; the harness measured global
sqrt at 9.4% median interior error vs 2.0% with sqrt confined to the seq axis,
while on the seq axis itself sqrt beats raw 3.2% vs 6.0%. (The legacy
pre-expansion encoded the same fact as `sqrt_y_value=True`.)

Recipe: **sqrt-on-seq for context-type ops (~seq^2); RAW everywhere else** —
DSA/CSA measured raw-linear per axis (their top-k saturation knee is itself
collected, so brackets never straddle it far). `util` as an *interpolation*
space is available but off by default: between two bracketing anchors the SOL
roughly cancels, and its `max(compute, mem)` ridge kink can hurt.

## 3. Validation philosophy

Accuracy is judged by **leave-one-out against measured latency**: hold out a
collected point (or an entire `(n,k)` site, or a seq row, or the boundary
shell), predict it from the rest, compare. Deviation from the *previous
system's* prediction is a sanity signal only — the old prediction is not
ground truth; single-digit % deviation is expected (interpolation is
inherently a few-percent instrument), and only 20-30%+ warrants
investigation. Every knob above had to win its LOO A/B or be deleted.

## 4. Accuracy evidence (real tables, leave-one-out)

Data: h100_sxm sglang 0.5.10 / vllm 0.19.0, gb200 sglang 0.5.10.

| Fold | median | p90 |
|---|---|---|
| GEMM interior (300 folds) | 4.87% | 15.6% |
| GEMM frontier (util-hold extrapolation) | **0.96%** | 8.4% |
| GEMM **site-holdout** (drop an entire `(n,k)` shape, predict from neighbours) | **3.63%** | 14.7% (0 misses) |
| context attention interior (batch-axis blends) | 2.00% | 9.7% |
| context attention seq-row holdout: sqrt vs raw | **3.21% vs 5.99%** | — |
| context attention global-sqrt vs per-axis sqrt (interior) | 9.44% -> **2.00%** | — |
| context MLA interior / frontier | 2.19% / 5.47% | 10.0% / 45% |
| context DSA, 4-axis leaf holdout, interior / frontier | 5.4% / 10.8% | 27% / 52% (0 misses; the s-grid is sparse around the top-k knee, and holding out a knee anchor is worst-case -- the signed knee fold below shows no systematic bias) |
| CSA (gb200) plain crossing vs regime-aware | **1.72% vs 1.92%** | 4.3% / 4.3% |
| CSA knee-just-above, signed | plain **+0.57%** vs regime −2.94% | — |
| GEMM **frontier-holdout** (scale-up waiver; drop all sites with `n > 8192`, predict measured `n = 65536` points through the waived path, ≥3 octaves — h200 vllm 0.24.0 / h100 trtllm 1.3.0rc15 / b200 sglang 0.5.10) | 10.1% / 8.9% / 15.1% | 83% / 51% / 112% |

The frontier-holdout tail is dominated by skinny `k <= 256` shapes whose
anchor util sits on the rising part of the saturation curve (signed error is
systematically **positive** — the hold overestimates latency, the safe
direction); at real LM-head dimensions (`k >= 2048`) the signed median is
+7~10%. On B60 against PR #1413's newly measured `n = 65536` rows, the
Llama-3.1-8B LM-head shape itself lands at 3.6–4.3% (bf16) / 10–11% (fp8).
Median-vs-IDW anchoring A/B'd equal (within 0.6% median), so the waiver
reuses the ordinary IDW transfer path.

Notable robustness result: 1705 ragged queries across four op families on the
raw (un-expanded) tables produced **zero crashes and zero Qhull errors** —
the corner-truncated frontier is fully absorbed by util-hold.

### 4.1 Final validation campaign (pre-ready)

Run before the PR left draft; all folds vs measured latency on real tables.

| Fold | Result |
|---|---|
| **Corner truncation** (delete the upper-right large-seq x large-batch triangle of every [s][b] plane, query the deleted points) | attention median 5.7% near the cut edge / 9.9% deep; MLA 4.8%; **0 misses in 620 queries** — the staircase fallback absorbs arbitrary corner loss |
| **Knee capture** (DSA top-k @ 2048; hold out knee-adjacent points, signed, h100+gb200, both archs, 118 folds) | knee-adjacent median **+1.0%** vs control +1.2% — no systematic over/under-shoot from linear crossing; p10 -40% reflects that deleting the knee anchor itself is unrecoverable by ANY interpolant (production tables collect the knee) |
| **Prefix / past-KV axis** (dsv4 sparse table, 26 past_kv values: hold out an entire past_kv row) | interior-row blend median **2.5%** p90 12%; 0 misses in 476 folds |
| **One-sided coverage** (hold a seq row, query its large batches where only ONE bracket side has coverage) | survivor-clamp scored **-41%/-44% signed median** (attention/MLA) -> SOL-ratio correction lands at **10.7%/8.3%** — this fold motivated the single-survivor semantic |
| generation attention / generation MLA leaf LOO | interior 1.1% / 1.2%; frontier 9.7% / 2.4% |
| **Task-level equivalence** (`aic default`, full agg+disagg sweep) | pareto rows match old engine at median 0.3% / max 2.1%; wall time 26-29s -> **~5-6s** |

Corner-tail attribution: the >100% corner errors concentrate in n<=2-head
slices with tiny absolute latencies (0.01-0.09 ms) — severely overhead-
dominated kernels where the SOL ratio over-predicts (the conservative
direction). Medians are single-digit everywhere else.

Known weakness (tracked): frontier *tails* are fat (p90 up to ~45-52% for
attention/MLA/DSA min-side edges) — extrapolating *below* the smallest
collected sizes is overhead-dominated and the SOL ratio overshoots. Median
behaviour is single-digit everywhere.

## 5. Defensive machinery this design retires

The pattern across all of these: a workaround for load-time pre-expansion, or
a hand-rolled copy of util-hold, or protection against an interpolation
method (cubic/scattered griddata) that the engine no longer uses.

### 5.1 The top-k regime-aware piecewise (the exemplar)

`interp_dsa_context_topk_piecewise_from_raw` (PR #903) restricted DSA context
interpolation to *same-regime* anchors around the `index_topk` boundary, and
required a pristine *raw* table to do it. Archaeology showed its two
motivations precisely:

1. the then-**cubic** 3-D interpolation overshot/underestimated just above
   the knee — cubic ringing at kinks is a real numerical phenomenon;
2. it had to consult **raw** rows because pre-expansion had polluted the
   working table with synthesized points.

The engine removes both root causes structurally: bracket blends are
**linear** (cannot overshoot a kink, and the knee `s = topk` is itself
collected, so brackets rarely straddle it), and tables are **raw** (no
pre-expansion). Leave-one-out on every real config — DeepseekV3.2 bf16/fp8,
GLM-5, and DSV4 CSA on gb200 — confirmed plain linear crossing ties or beats
the piecewise, including *just above the boundary* (+0.57% vs −2.94%), i.e.
the original symptom cannot be reproduced under the new mechanism. Deleted
with its tests.

### 5.2 Hand-rolled util-holds (three independent copies)

- DSA generation's `boundary_util_value` — freeze boundary util, scale by
  SOL ratio;
- MoE's `_estimate_overflow_with_last_token_util` (~65 lines) — same, for
  token overflow;
- `scale_matrix`'s clamp + `SOL(q)/SOL(boundary)` ratio — its own comment
  said "freeze utilization at the clamped boundary".

All three are the engine's step 3 verbatim. Deleted; their call sites are one
engine query each.

### 5.3 Raw-vs-expanded double bookkeeping

DSA, DSV4 and generation attention each kept a `deepcopy` of the loaded
table *before* expansion (`_raw_*_data`) so regime lookups and boundary
anchoring could avoid synthesized points, plus logic to prefer measured rows
over expanded ones ("an exact batch in the working table may itself be a
load-time extrapolation target"). With no pre-expansion the table *is* the
raw data: the copies became aliases and the preference logic was deleted.

### 5.4 Robust-lookup layers

`_dsv4_robust_3d_lookup` / `_dsv4_lookup_prefix_resolved` (exact -> cubic ->
covering-batch interpolation -> largest-lower-batch x batch scaling; per-
prefix slices + clamped 1-D across prefix) existed to survive ragged clouds
that crashed scattered cubic interpolation (QhullError on degenerate axes).
The Grid resolver's bracket + branch-drop + util-hold handles the same
inputs natively; both helpers and their eight white-box tests are gone.

### 5.5 Pre-expansion itself

`extrapolate_data_grid`, its 12 per-op `_extrapolate` methods and 18
`_*_TARGET_*` grid constants (~30k synthesized nodes per quant-mode,
order-dependent interpolation-of-interpolation, and the source of the
"Skipping interpolation" warning spam on ragged inputs) are deleted. Also
gone: raw-linear extrapolations that could undershoot launch-overhead floors
or go negative below the smallest collected size (NCCL/allreduce message
sizes, MoE token underflow, DSV4 decode below min `s_total`).

### 5.6 The DSV4 sparse-kernel helper (the last scipy consumer)

`_lookup_sparse_kernel` (DSV4 CP kernel-DELTA correction: `paged_mqa_logits` /
`hca_attn`) was the final holdout — it looked like it "had no natural SOL". It
does: the kernel scores (past + isl/2) KV pairs per query token per sequence,
so `SOL = b * (past * isl + isl^2/2)` follows from the code's own stated
premises (the `x bs/bp` batch contract and the CP path's "super-linear
sub-kernels" comment). The migration is a bug fix, not a risk trade:

- the sparse sweep collects isl <= 8k while the CP path needs `mqa_full` at
  the FULL sequence length (128k+). The CP composition resolves this with an
  IN-GRID CHUNK DECOMPOSITION (`_mqa_chunked`): the pair count is additive
  over prefill chunks, `mqa(isl, past) = sum_k mqa(chunk, past + k*chunk)`,
  which is exactly the kernel sequence chunked prefill launches and keeps
  every lookup inside the collected grid (isl <= 8192, past_kv collected to
  ~1M) — no extrapolation at all (review credit: PR #1303).
- for the residual beyond-range case (direct sparse-helper queries past the
  sweep, no production caller after the decomposition): hold-out A/B on all
  288 slices, truncate to `max_isl/4`, predict the frontier, SIGNED and
  STRATIFIED BY STEP — legacy linear-trend median -66%..-21% per stratum;
  util-hold under the pair-count SOL: **step=0 +25.6%** (n=12, anchors
  UNSATURATED — util still climbing at the boundary), 0<step<4096 +10.2%,
  step>=4096 **-8.1%** (the saturated regime). The earlier pooled "-1%" was
  these strata cancelling — a pooled median hid real structure, which is why
  this table is stratified. Guarding unsaturated anchors (util-slope
  threshold before holding) is tracked as follow-up;
- the legacy largest-lower-batch x `bs/bp` scaling is replaced by measured
  batch brackets — the old robust-lookup comments themselves called linear
  batch scaling the worse estimate ("simply scaling the lower batch can
  nearly double latency").

With it gone the scipy interp family (`interp_1d/2d/3d`, griddata wrappers,
nearest-point helpers, the `_extracted_metrics_cache` plumbing) lost its last
consumer and `interpolation.py` was deleted outright: the structured-miss
error class lives in `sdk/errors.py` (next to its siblings), the `get_value`
leaf accessor lives in `perf_interp`, and **scipy is no longer a dependency
of the wheel**.

### 5.7 Contracts deliberately preserved

Not everything old was defensive cruft — some behaviors are deliberate and
test-locked, and survive unchanged at op level:

- `compute_scale` is a quantization-overhead *delta*: beyond its grid it is
  held **flat** at the clamped boundary (not SOL-scaled).
- Mamba's degradation contract: a genuine data miss returns plain SOL
  (`source="sol"`), it does not raise.
- MoE singleton-underflow still raises (a lone 1024-token row cannot define
  the low-token launch floor); HYBRID falls through to the empirical path.
- The CSA top-k DELTA *calibration* (measured collector-vs-representative
  correction) is orthogonal to interpolation and kept verbatim.

## 6. Current state and remaining work

- **Every query path resolves through `perf_interp`.** `interpolation.py`
  is deleted (see 5.6): `InterpolationDataNotAvailableError` moved to
  `sdk/errors.py`, `get_value` to `perf_interp`; scipy is out of the
  dependency list.
- The DeepEP `sms` axis has no scaling story (only sm=20 is collected);
  off-grid `sms` snaps to the nearest collected value until data exists.
- Frontier-tail accuracy (min-side extrapolation) is the main quality
  follow-up; medians are single-digit everywhere.
- CP note: `_lookup_sparse_kernel`'s SOL is CP-agnostic by design — the CP
  model lives entirely in the caller (`_query_cp`), which queries the base at
  `per_card = ceil(isl/cp)` tokens and swaps the super-linear sub-kernels as
  `full/cp - per_card`. The helper only ever sees already-resolved token
  counts; the `/cp` division *is* the perfect-parallelism assumption.
