# Collector Layer Permissions

Which layer of the collector may hold which kind of rule. This is the single
most important reference when "fixing" a failing case: pick the layer first,
then act. Violating these boundaries is how the retired sm_exceptions rule
engine grew to 1400 lines of shape-sniping rules.

## The one-line architecture

```text
plan cases = dedup( expand(base_ops sweep grids) ∪ expand(model_case_values shapes) )
runnable   = plan cases ∩ hardware capability floors  −  hang denylist
result     = perf rows  +  classified failure records   (failure is DATA, not a defect)
```

## Permission table

| Layer | Allowed | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| `cases/base_ops/*.yaml` | sweep density/ranges; axis-level `min_sm` on quant/precision modes; quant-mode-level `max_sm_exclusive` **iff** the entry carries a serving-dispatch citation (file:line at the pinned framework version) showing the framework itself excludes the platform — re-verified on every version bump like `FIXME(kernel-limit)` | per-model special cases; shape exclusion rules; `max_sm_exclusive` without a citation or below the quant-mode axis |
| `cases/models/*_cases.yaml` | model structural shapes, correlated tuples, artifact/quant policy, op activation (`cases: all`) | selectors, match rules, a second generator recipe |
| `cases/capabilities.yaml` | positive dtype/op → min-SM floors (hardware facts only) | negative "drop" rules; shape axes; framework-version conditions; per-backend nesting |
| `<backend>/registry.py` | version routing (`VersionRoute`); maturity markers `unverified=True` (op × backend) and `unverified_sms=(...)` (op × backend × SM) | any shape-level information |
| `collect_*.py` collector code | **dispatch**: pick kernel path by SM/version, record `kernel_source`; runtime probe → **raise a classified exception**; **memory-feasibility filter** (see below) | silent `continue`/skip of a queued case; any other case filtering; patching code so one shape passes |
| `cases/denylist.yaml` | cases that HANG or kill the node (dated, with reason) | ordinary crashes — those belong to the failure log |
| executor (`collect.py`) | — mechanism is off-limits during case-fixing tasks | changing checkpoint/case-ID/failure-classification logic to make a case pass |
| failure records (`errors_*.json`, summary) | append-only observation | feeding failures back into ANY declaration layer as new rules |

## The dispatch/skip discriminator

> A legal branch changes HOW a case runs. An illegal branch changes WHETHER it runs.

- Legal: `if sm >= 100: use kernel A else kernel B` — both sides produce a data
  point (and record which kernel).
- Illegal: `if sm < 90: continue` — the case vanishes with no data and no
  failure record.

A collector has exactly two legal responses to a queued case: **execute it, or
raise**. "Whether it runs" is decided only outside the collector, in three
auditable places: capability floors (generation time), registry `unverified`
markers, and the hang denylist.

## Kernel/backend selection: framework truth, never your guess

A collector measures what the framework would actually run in serving. The
kernel/backend invoked for a (model, phase, dtype/quant, shape, SM) case MUST
be the one the framework's own dispatch selects under those conditions —
never chosen by familiarity, assumption, or "this backend should be right".
A benchmark that successfully invokes the wrong backend produces silently
wrong data, which is worse than a crash.

1. **Prefer the framework's own dispatch path.** Construct modules through
   the framework's builder/selector so backend selection happens exactly as
   in serving (the `ops/build_transformer_layer` approach), instead of
   manually instantiating a specific backend class.
2. **Manual pinning requires source proof.** If a backend must be pinned,
   the pin needs a comment citing the framework source (file:line at the
   pinned version) showing that this is what the framework selects for those
   conditions — SM- and dtype-dependent branches included.
3. **`kernel_source` records ground truth**, the actually-invoked kernel —
   never the intended one.
4. **Re-verify on every version bump.** Dispatch logic is precisely what
   framework upgrades change. The upgrade audit re-checks every pinned
   backend and every `FIXME(kernel-limit)` against the new source before
   collected data is trusted.
5. **No invented fallbacks.** If the framework-selected path cannot be
   constructed or invoked, raise a classified error — never substitute
   another backend "to keep collecting"; a try/except backend swap is the
   most deceptive form of wrong-data. Replicating a fallback chain is legal
   only when the framework itself performs it in serving, and
   `kernel_source` must record what actually ran. Measurement-method
   degradation (e.g. CUDA-graph capture falling back to eager) is allowed
   only when recorded in the output row (`used_cuda_graph`-style flags).
   The same applies to API-compat shims: they may only change HOW the same
   kernel is constructed, never WHICH kernel runs — version-divergent
   selection belongs in registry version forks.

## Metadata/input parity: serving truth, never reconstruction

The rule above covers WHICH kernel runs; this one covers WHAT state it
receives. A collector that hand-builds framework metadata or input tensors
(attention metadata fields, KV-cache params, position ids, workspace
shapes) is replicating serving-internal state, and every replicated field
is a contract that can silently drift. Origin: the SM100 DSA cached-KV IMA
(2026-07-19) — one uncited `prompt_lens` semantics change (full length vs
serving's chunk-local length, f027123f) crashed every prefix>0 DSA context
case on B200 while staying invisible on H20, because only the SM100 kernel
path consumes that field for dense-input walking.

1. **Every hand-constructed metadata field / input tensor needs a serving
   citation** (file:line at the pinned framework version) showing the
   population site it mirrors — the same standard as pinned backends. A
   metadata field changed without a citation is a review finding even when
   the change makes cases pass.
2. **Serving-parity audit before framework blame.** Before concluding a
   crash is a framework bug — and before writing any FIXME(kernel-limit)
   for it — diff EVERY collector-constructed field against the serving
   population code (`model_engine._prepare_tp_inputs` and friends) for the
   failing request shape, field by field. Kernel localization (traceback,
   compute-sanitizer) tells you WHERE it faulted, never WHOSE contract was
   violated; comparing which module function is routed to is not the audit.
3. **Platform-green ≠ field-correct.** A pass on SM A validates only the
   fields SM A's kernel path consumes. A failure exclusive to SM B should
   FIRST suspect fields only SM B's path reads.
4. **Version bumps re-verify the metadata contract**, not just kernel
   dispatch: the upgrade audit re-checks every serving citation on
   metadata/input construction against the new framework source.

## The one sanctioned in-collector filter: memory feasibility

Device memory is a permanent hardware fact, but its expression needs
op-specific arithmetic (KV cache, weights, activation peaks) that only the
collector knows. Therefore a collector MAY filter cases on memory
feasibility, under exactly these conditions:

1. **Generation time only** — inside `get_*_test_cases()`, so the case is
   never queued. Never a runtime `continue`.
2. **Predicate = size vs capacity, nothing else** — preferred:
   `estimated_footprint(shape) > device_total_memory * safety_factor` with
   memory queried live (`torch.cuda.get_device_properties`); acceptable
   fallback: a shape metric against a per-SM/per-capacity constant. NEVER
   framework-version or model-name conditions — that is exception smuggling.
3. **Drops are counted, never silent** — log one line:
   `<op>: dropped N/M cases (memory budget, device=<GB>)`.

Anything beyond this pattern goes back to the normal rule: run it or raise.

## Parking framework kernel limits: `FIXME(kernel-limit)`

Framework kernel limits (backend × SM constraints with shape flavor, e.g.
"Blackwell attention rejects GQA ratio >= 32 unless divisible by 32") are
neither hardware facts (not capabilities.yaml material) nor version bugs
(too stable to ignore). Their home is a **`FIXME(kernel-limit)` comment at
the invocation site in the owning collector**, stating the claimed limit,
its origin, and that it is unverified. The affected cases simply fail at
runtime meanwhile.

Lifecycle: on the next framework version bump, the upgrade audit greps
`FIXME(kernel-limit)`, verifies each claim against the framework source, and
either implements it as a probe (ask the framework's own selector — never a
prediction) or a guard that raises a classified error citing the framework
source line, or deletes the note. Do not implement guards from unverified
claims, and never express these limits in YAML.

## Module boundary: a collector task may only touch collector/

The collector's outward surface is its **data contract**: the perf row schema
(columns written by `helper.log_perf`), the canonical filenames
(`registry_types.PerfFile`), and the parquet finalization format. Everything
downstream — `src/aiconfigurator/sdk/perf_database.py`, the Rust
`aiconfigurator-core` operators, `tools/support_matrix/`, packaged data under
`src/aiconfigurator/systems/data/` — consumes that contract.

Rules:

1. A collector task may modify `collector/` and `tests/unit/collector/`.
   **Nothing else.** Not the SDK, not Rust, not tools, not systems data, not
   the generator — even when the collector change "obviously needs" a
   consumer-side change to be useful.
2. **Changing the data contract requires explicit human approval.** Adding a
   column, a new perf file, a new key dimension, or renaming anything the SDK
   parses is a producer+consumer coordinated change. If you discover the need
   mid-task: STOP, write up the proposal (new dimension, why, which consumers
   must change), and hand it to the human. Do not implement both sides
   "while you're at it". Approval — not PR count — is the requirement: an
   explicitly approved framework-upgrade PR that declares the contract change
   may carry the coordinated producer and consumer changes together; two
   dependent PRs are equally acceptable.
3. The reverse holds too: SDK/modeling tasks do not reach into `collector/`.
4. These rule files themselves (`.claude/rules/collector/`) are human-owned
   policy. Do not edit them as a side effect of a fix task; propose changes
   instead.

## Governed exceptions

A rule in this file may be temporarily excepted ONLY through an entry in the
`standards_exceptions` registry (`collector/evidence_exceptions.yaml`), and
only when the entry carries ALL of:

1. **A self-contained machine-readable scope** — the rule excepted, plus the
   exact tables/backend/versions/systems the exception covers. Prose-only
   scoping is invalid.
2. **The standards owner's `approved_by` sign-off.** These rule files are
   human-owned policy; only their owner can except them.
3. **An `expires` date and a linked retirement work item.** An exception is
   a debt with a due date, not a policy change; on expiry the exception is
   renewed by the owner or the deviation is fixed.
4. **Consumer-visible provenance** — the deviation must be discoverable from
   the shipped data's own declaration layer (e.g. the `reuse.yaml` reason or
   sidecar for the affected tables), never only from this registry.

An exception documents and bounds a deviation; it does not weaken the rule.
Reviews treat an in-scope, unexpired entry as compliant and everything
outside its scope as an ordinary violation.

## Meta rules

1. **Default action for a failing case is NO CHANGE.** Confirm it is recorded
   and classified in the failure log, then stop. Escalate only per the decision
   tree in `failure_handling.md`.
2. **Mechanism changes need explicit human approval.** The executor, case
   generator engine, failure classification, and case-ID format are mechanism.
   Propose changes; do not fold them into a "fix this case" task.
3. **Inexpressibility is the guardrail.** The YAML schemas here deliberately
   cannot express shape conditions or version predicates. Do not extend the
   schemas to allow them.
4. **A test that only works with `-m unit` unmarked is invisible to CI.** Mark
   new collector tests `pytest.mark.unit`.
