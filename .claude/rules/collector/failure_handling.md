# Collector Failure Handling

Core doctrine: **observe, don't predict.** A failing case costs seconds and is
recorded automatically with a classification. A prediction rule costs
maintenance forever, rots when the framework fixes the bug, and depends on
fragile matching contracts. The system therefore has NO declarative
expected-failure layer — and deliberately no auto-skip either: if a whole
group is failing, it should be FIXED, not silently tolerated.

## What happens automatically (no action needed)

- Every worker failure is recorded in `errors_<module>.json` and
  `collection_summary_<backend>.json` with `classification: "unexpected"`,
  the case parameters, exception type/message, and a `(model, dtype)` group
  label. The summary aggregates `errors_by_group`; a group with many failures
  is logged as a fix-me warning.
- CUDA-fatal errors reset the worker process; the task is already recorded
  before the reset.
- Missing data points are tolerated downstream: the SDK interpolates,
  extrapolates, reuses sibling-version rows, and can fall back to HYBRID
  empirical estimates. A handful of failed cases does NOT invalidate a
  (system, backend, version) dataset.

## Decision tree for a failing case

```text
case failed
├─ Is it recorded & classified in the failure log?  → yes → DONE (default path)
├─ Does it HANG or kill the node?                   → denylist.yaml entry (dated + reason)
├─ Whole (op × backend) never debugged?             → registry OpEntry unverified=True
├─ Not validated on THIS SM only?                   → registry OpEntry unverified_sms=(sm,)
├─ Physically impossible on this hardware?          → capabilities.yaml positive floor
│    (dtype doesn't exist below SM X — NOT "this framework version lacks a kernel")
├─ Out of memory?                                   → treat as unclassified until it
│    reproduces on a clean GPU; if real, the collector's generation-time memory
│    filter may exclude it (see layer_permissions.md — the one sanctioned filter)
├─ Crash inside framework code, framework suspected? → serving-parity audit FIRST
│    (diff every collector-built metadata/input field against the serving
│    population site for the failing shape — layer_permissions.md
│    "Metadata/input parity"); a FIXME(kernel-limit) or framework-bug report
│    is only legitimate after the audit finds no collector-side divergence
└─ Proven collector-code bug?                       → fix the code; never fix via skip;
                                                      re-check the dispatch/skip rule
```

Framework-version gaps (an rc that crashes on some shape, a backend that has
no SM120 recipe yet) deliberately have NO home in YAML. They fail, the log
explains them grouped by (model, dtype), and the next version bump re-tests
them for free. A fully-failing group burns some GPU time — that cost is the
intended pressure to actually fix it (mark unverified, fix the collector, or
accept the gap knowingly).

## Triage thresholds (from collection-campaign experience)

- Isolated failures — even a few dozen across a large plan — are acceptable
  when explained and unclustered.
- Investigate around 10% unexpected failures, or earlier when failures cluster
  by op, backend, dtype, model, shape family, or SM.
- Roughly one third failing, or an entire family failing, is a systemic
  collector problem — stop collecting, fix the collector.
- Treat an OOM as unclassified until the same case fails on a clean GPU.

Never hide failures with broad skips, retries, generic OOM labels, reduced
coverage, synthetic rows, or weakened benchmarks. Record a failed result
before resetting a worker after a fatal CUDA error.

## Consuming failure records

- Compare against the previous run of the same (backend, version): only NEW
  failure groups deserve attention.
- Failure records are observations. Do not machine-translate them into
  denylist/capability entries — each escalation above requires the specific
  evidence named in the tree.
