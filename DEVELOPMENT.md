# Developer Guide

This guide will help you get started with developing `aiconfigurator`. We welcome contributions from the community!

## Initial Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aiconfigurator
cd aiconfigurator
```

Current performance profiles are checked-in Parquet files. Git LFS is only
needed when developing against retained legacy `*.txt` perf assets or running
their compatibility tests; for that work, install Git LFS and run
`git lfs pull`.

### 2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Development Dependencies

```bash
# Install the standalone core and upper package in editable mode
pip install -e ./aic-core
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 5. Install Pre-Commit Hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This installs:
- The upper `aiconfigurator` package in editable mode
- The standalone SDK/data/native `aiconfigurator-core` package in editable mode
- All runtime dependencies
- Development tools: `ruff`, `pre-commit`, `pytest` and related plugins

### Optional: Install Ruff Extension

If you are using VS Code or one of its forks (e.g. Cursor), you can install the [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) which will highlight linting issues in your editor. You can also configure your editor to auto-apply formatting when saving files using the instructions [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20you%20can%20configure%20Ruff%20to%20format%2C%20fix%2C%20and%20organize%20imports%20on%2Dsave%20via%20the%20following%20settings.json%3A).

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Linting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting.

#### Run Linting

```bash
# Check for linting issues
ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check --fix .
```

#### Run Formatting

```bash
# Check formatting
ruff format --check .

# Apply formatting
ruff format .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run checks before each commit.

#### Run Pre-commit Manually

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Running Tests

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests

# Run tests for a specific component
pytest tests/unit
pytest tests/e2e

# GitHub PR / build subset (unit + a small stable E2E subset)
pytest -m "unit or build"
```

## Data Collection (Advanced)

Data collection is typically not required for development. The repository includes pre-collected performance databases for supported systems.

If you need to collect new data for a new GPU type or framework version, refer to the [Collector README](collector/README.md).
