"""
Predictor strategy for single-point worker perf prediction.

A ``Predictor`` defines *how* one config point's performance is predicted.
Today's only implementation is :class:`AnalyticPredictor`, which wraps
``backend.run_agg`` (analytic IFB simulation, steady-state) and
``backend.run_static`` (single forward step) -- this matches the
pre-Predictor behavior of the SDK exactly.

Future implementations may swap in different prediction strategies:

- ``DynamicPredictor`` -- models dynamic-traffic effects (queueing under
  concurrency) beyond the steady-state assumption baked into the analytic
  predictor.
- ``MockerPredictor`` -- a seam for Dynamo Mocker's request-level
  discrete-event simulation, useful for per-request metrics (e.g. from a
  Mooncake-style trace) rather than aggregate latency / throughput.
  Note the integration is inverted relative to the analytic path: Dynamo
  Mocker imports AIC and drives its ``run_static`` / ``run_agg``, so a
  Mocker-backed predictor wraps that path rather than AIC delegating out
  to Mocker.

Callers (``predict.predict_*``, ``sweep.sweep_*``, ``task.Task.run``)
accept an optional ``predictor`` argument that defaults to
:data:`DEFAULT_PREDICTOR` (a single :class:`AnalyticPredictor` instance).
The Protocol surface is intentionally minimal -- only the two prediction
entry points the current SDK uses are required.  Future Mocker-style
predictors that need a different shape (e.g. whole-disagg-system replay
rather than per-phase prediction) can extend the Protocol with
additional methods at the time they are needed; today's two methods are
sufficient for both agg and disagg paths.
