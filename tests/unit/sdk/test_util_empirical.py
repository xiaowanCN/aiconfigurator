"""Tests for the empirical-provenance pipeline.

The estimation MATH that used to be tested here (``UtilGrid`` interpolation,
``grid_for``/``grid_from_reference`` caching, ``estimate`` transfer ladder,
``require_data_slice``) retired to the compiled engine with #1357 PR-5; its
behaviour is anchored by the frozen parity goldens
and the frozen parity goldens. What remains observable from Python — and
tested here — is the provenance pipeline the engine reports back through.
