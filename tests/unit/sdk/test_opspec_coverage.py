"""Structural tripwire: every ``Operation`` must reach the compiled engine.

The Rust engine executes whatever ``engine.py::_to_opspec`` emits. An op class
added on the Python side WITHOUT a conversion branch silently forces the whole
model back onto the (frozen) Python step — exactly the drift the Python-path
freeze forbids. This test makes that state un-mergeable: a new ``Operation``
subclass must either get a ``_to_opspec`` branch (plus its Rust mirror and a
parity case — see ``.claude/rules/rust-core/parity.md``) or an explicit,
justified entry in ``EXEMPT`` below.

The Rust side has the symmetric guard: ``engine/spec.rs::all_op_variants``
fails to compile when an ``Op`` variant is added without wiring.
