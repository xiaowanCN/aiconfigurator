"""Completeness of the table-view attribute registry across its sites.

The view registry used to live in four hand-synchronized, stringly-typed
places: the Rust dispatch match arms (with per-attribute parquet basenames),
Python's ``VIEW_KEY_LAYERS``, each op class's ``load_data`` literals, and the
retired migration baseline's codec. Two of the drift modes were SILENT (an
attribute missing from ``VIEW_KEY_LAYERS`` only fails on machines that have
that family's data; a basename typo in a Rust arm makes the view answer None
with no error). The engine exports the registry
(``aiconfigurator_core.table_view_attributes()``, same single-source pattern
as ``gemm_quant_util_levels``); these tests pin every other site to it:

* ``VIEW_KEY_LAYERS`` covers exactly the exported attributes;
* every exported basename is a known ``PerfDataFilename`` value (a typo in
  the registry cannot survive; a typo in a MATCH ARM is caught by the
  synthetic-parquet view-shape suites, which pin each fold's dispatch);
* every exported attribute actually dispatches (fetching it against a real
  pinned database returns a table or None — never "unknown attribute").
