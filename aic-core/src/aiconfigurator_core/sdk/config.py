class AFDConfig:
    """Configuration for Attention-FFN Disaggregated (AFD) serving mode.

    In AFD mode, Attention ops run on A-Workers while FFN/MoE ops run on
    F-Workers.  The two pools communicate activation tensors every layer.

    The deployment topology is described by the triple
    ``(n_a_nodes, n_f_nodes, gpus_per_node)``.  The A/F rank mapping is
    static and determined at deployment time — AIC models this as a
    configuration input, not a dynamic scheduling problem.

    Single-source-of-truth invariants
    ---------------------------------
    ``gpus_per_node`` is **not** a user-tunable knob: once the target
    system is picked, this is a hardware fact (h100_sxm/h200_sxm = 8,
    gb200 = 4, …). Callers must inject the value from
    ``system_spec["node"]["num_gpus_per_node"]`` — the default sentinel
    of ``0`` makes "I forgot to inject" loud rather than silently
    mis-shaping ``n_f_workers`` / ``AFDTransfer`` BW selection. A
    yaml/CLI "what-if" override is allowed but must be done deliberately
    (the constructing layer is responsible for cross-checking against
    the spec).

    ``tp_f`` is the **total GPU count of one F-replica** (i.e. the
    ``ModelConfig.tp_size`` used to shape the F-Worker model). Under the
    Phase 1 assumption F-side DP=1, that's exactly ``n_f_workers``, so
    ``tp_f`` is derived — exposing it as a user input opens a foot-gun
    (e.g. ``n_f_nodes=2, gpus_per_node=8, tp_f=8`` silently implies
    F-DP=2). The sentinel ``0`` requests automatic derivation; passing
    a non-zero value triggers an invariant check.

    Derived quantities (computed in ``__post_init__``):

    * ``n_a_workers`` — A-side DP count = ``n_a_nodes * gpus_per_node // tp_a``
    * ``n_f_workers`` — total F-side GPUs = ``n_f_nodes * gpus_per_node``
    * ``tp_f``        — set to ``n_f_workers`` (Phase 1: F-DP = 1)

    AFD is orthogonal to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregation — it can be
    applied to the Decode phase (default, where batch concentration benefits
    are strongest), to the Prefill phase, or to both phases simultaneously.
