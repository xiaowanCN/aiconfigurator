"""Whole-model forward-pass op backed by collected ``fpm_forward_perf`` data.

With ``ModelConfig.forward_model == "fpm"`` the model builder replaces each
phase op list with exactly one :class:`FPMForwardOp`. The op is
CONSTRUCTION-ONLY on the Python side: it carries the cell-match identity, the
whole-model weight bytes, and the original granular op list, and
``sdk/engine.py::_to_opspec`` serializes those into the compiled engine's
``Op::FpmForward`` — the Rust core owns the loader
(``perf_database/fpm_forward.rs``), the interpolation/clamp semantics
(``operators/fpm_forward.rs``), and the whole-model SOL roofline derived from
the granular list (``operators/fpm_sol.rs``). The formal database pair it
reads:

    systems/data/<system>/<backend>/<version>/fpm_forward_perf.parquet
    systems/data/<system>/<backend>/<version>/fpm_forward_perf.metadata.json

(The former Python-side query/loader machinery — the per-call ``query()``
family, the parquet/sidecar validators, and the per-op ``DatabaseMode.SOL``
roofline closure — was retired with the Python engine-step path; the Rust
implementations are the single owners now.)
