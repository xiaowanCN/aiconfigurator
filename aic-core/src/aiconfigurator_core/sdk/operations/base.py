"""
Base class and shared infrastructure for the operations package.

This module defines the ``Operation`` ABC plus two pieces of shared
infrastructure that future op classes will rely on:

- **Class-level ``_data_cache``** — each Operation subclass that owns CSV data
  overrides this in its own class. Keyed by ``(system_path, db_mode)`` so the
  same op type can serve multiple databases in one process.
- **``_load_data_call_count`` instrumentation** — used by tests to assert
  which op classes actually loaded data during a model run. The expected set
  for Minimax M2.5 NVFP4 is the canonical lazy-load success assertion
  (see ``~/forks/sdk-refactor-regression/tests/test_load_data_counts.py``).
- **``supported_quant_modes`` classmethod** — placeholder API used by
  ``inference_session`` post-Phase-4 to build the support-matrix warning.
  Default returns the empty set; ops with quant-mode-keyed CSVs override.

``clear_all_op_caches()`` is a module-level utility that walks every
``Operation`` subclass and clears both its data cache and any LRU on
``query``. Exported from the ``aiconfigurator_core.sdk.operations`` package — same
function powers a pytest ``autouse`` fixture and serves as a manual eviction
lever for long-running webapps.
