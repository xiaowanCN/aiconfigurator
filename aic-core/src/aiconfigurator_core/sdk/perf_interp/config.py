"""Per-op config schema for the perf-table interpolation engine (v2).

Declarative interface only: each op describes its table's shape and physics in
one ``OpInterpConfig`` record; a single shared resolver engine (next commit)
executes it. Adding an op = adding a record, not a code path.

The problem
-----------
A perf table is a ragged nested dict ``data[x][y][z] -> leaf`` (leaf = latency
float or ``{"latency", "energy"}``). Exactly two table shapes exist today, and
the engine models exactly those two — nothing more generic:

* **Scattered sites + curve** (GEMM): ``(n, k)`` are discrete real matmul
  shapes — scattered, NOT a Cartesian grid (the reverse shape usually doesn't
  exist, and dense m-sweeps are collected at specific shapes only). Modeled as
  independent sites, each owning its own m-curve.
* **Grid, possibly corner-truncated** (attention / MLA): near-regular
  (heads, seq, batch) grids where the large-seq x large-batch corner is omitted
  (OOM / collection cost), leaving a staircase frontier.

Resolution order (the whole engine in four steps)
-------------------------------------------------
1. **exact hit** -> return the measured leaf verbatim.
2. **resolve within the data**
   - ``Grid``: descend the nesting; per level, exact key collapses the level,
     otherwise bracket between existing keys and blend in ``value_transform``
     space; a missing branch is dropped and weight renormalized (raggedness).
   - ``ScatteredSites``: if the site (e.g. exact ``(n, k)``) is collected,
     evaluate its curve alone; otherwise pick the nearest sites (log-space
     distance, filtered to sites whose curve range covers the query) and
     combine their curve evaluations in UTIL space by inverse-distance weight.
3. **beyond the collected range** -> hold the boundary util
   (``util = SOL/latency``, anchored on the median of the last ``k_tail``
   points so a sawtooth edge doesn't bias it) and return
   ``latency = SOL(query) / util``. Extrapolation is UNBOUNDED by design:
   outside the data, the analytic SOL is the only signal we have — holding
   measured efficiency and letting physics carry the growth is the honest
   answer at any distance, so there is no distance cap.
4. **nothing to anchor on** -> genuine miss: raise. (Empty table / empty
   branch, or no site within ``max_site_distance`` for an interior-hole or
   scale-down query — the gate is waived for a query beyond the scale-up
   frontier, which resolves via step 2's nearest-site transfer.) The engine
   never fabricates a value from nothing.

Invariants (deliberately NOT knobs)
-----------------------------------
* Site **distances** are measured in log space (scale-free shape similarity).
  Bracket **blend weights** use the plain coordinate — curvature is what
  ``value_transform`` is for (raw is exact for ~linear physics, sqrt for
  ~seq^2), and a log-space lerp would break that exactness.
* **Cross-site transfer and extrapolation are always in util space.** A
  neighbouring shape's latency is meaningless at the query shape, but its
  efficiency transfers, and ``SOL(query)`` re-applies the correct scaling.
* **A measured point is returned exactly** — the engine never smooths
  collected data (protects the GEMM-m wave-quantization sawtooth; fine
  structure is the collector's job to sample, ours to preserve).
* Energy rides along: interpolate measured power (= energy/latency, smooth and
  bounded) with the same weights, then ``energy = power * latency``.

The one knob that stays a knob
------------------------------
``value_transform`` — the space used for interpolation BETWEEN measured points
of the same slice/grid. Between two bracketing anchors SOL roughly cancels, so
util buys nothing there and its ``max(compute, mem)`` regime kink can hurt;
``sqrt`` linearises the ~seq^2 curvature of context attention. Defaults are set
per op from leave-one-out evidence and re-decided by the LOO harness — not by
taste.

Deliberately not built
----------------------
No extrapolation distance cap (see step 3). No per-axis mode enum and no EXACT
mode (an exact key collapses a level naturally). No ``on_miss`` policy knob
(a genuine miss raises; that is the SDK contract). No plugin/Protocol layer for
hypothetical future engines. No Delaunay/griddata/RBF/learned surrogate. No
per-axis coordinate-transform knob (log is fixed).

Validation
----------
Leave-one-out against MEASURED latency (hold out a collected point / an entire
site / the boundary shell; predict; compare). Deviation from a previous
system's prediction is a sanity signal only — single-digit % is expected and
fine; only 20-30%+ warrants investigation. Every knob above must win its LOO
A/B or be deleted.
