"""Solving the work-delta unit prices from measured calibration batches.

Each calibration batch was built around one average point holding both totals
fixed, so subtracting the average point's latency removes everything that
depends on the totals alone and leaves the cost of the spread:

    y = T_batch - T_uniform

Two prices, because a prefill batch is charged on two different shapes: the
candidate-scoring trapezoid a row presents by crossing ``topk``, and the
attention pairs every row actually reads. See :mod:`planner` for what each
column does and does not include -- in particular, a sub-``topk`` row's indexer
scan is priced through ``c_mla``, not ``c_idx``.

Nothing here fits both at once. The order is forced by what each segment
can move, and each step subtracts what the previous one already fixed:

    1. c_mla  from the unsaturated segments. No row crosses ``topk``, so
       ``x_idx`` is identically zero by the column definition and the segment
       pins ``c_mla`` on its own -- the whole below-bound price, a row's
       attention together with its own indexer scan. Solved per cell like
       every other price: an earlier revision shared it across cells as a
       kernel property, and measurement rejected that (see :mod:`planner` --
       the ratio varies by orders of magnitude between cells). At a cell whose
       average request is long it cannot be measured from a pure segment at
       all, because a capped row reads at most ``topk`` tokens while the
       cell's own work grows with ``s_bar^2`` -- there the mixed segment
       carries it (step 3).

    2. c_idx  from each cell's saturated segment. Every row is above ``topk``
       so the indexer is pinned there for all of them, which makes the attention
       term linear in ``s``; with ``sum(s)`` conserved its deviation cancels
       exactly and only the gated column survives.

    3. the remaining price from the mixed segment, with whatever step 1 and step 2
       already fixed subtracted out. At a saturated average point that leaves
       one unknown; at an unsaturated one the cell has no saturated segment, so
       ``c_idx`` is unknown too and the mixed data carries both.

The rungs within a segment are not redundancy. A coefficient fitted at one
imbalance magnitude says nothing about whether the relation is linear; rungs
spanning the segment's own range make the residual meaningful. A large
residual is the signal that the linear form is strained for that cell rather
than that the measurement was noisy -- a diagnostic to read, never a gate:
``CellFit.accepted`` is structural only.

                          survives. One rung fixes c_idx outright.
        pure unsaturated  every row is at or below topk, so the top-k selection

    up to three rungs per segment, and refuses a segment below its floor -- two
    rungs for a pure or saturated-point-mixed segment, three for a mixed
    segment at an unsaturated average point, where the mixed rungs carry both
    unknowns alone.

    Repeated rungs in a pure segment are averaged by median rather than

    neighbouring batch sizes. Both go through the same gates here rather than
    each re-deriving them, so an interpolated correction is held to what a

    Three gates, in order, and all-or-nothing: a partial correction leaves the
    surviving column to explain the whole delta and overshoots (measured max
    error 87.6% -> 207.8%, worse than not correcting at all).

    1. An unpriced column must be carrying no work. A price comes back ``None``
       when the cell's segments could not identify it, and the usual reason is
       that the column is identically zero throughout the cell -- a purely
       unsaturated cell prices nothing for crossing ``topk`` because none of
       its batches can cross it. There the missing price multiplies zero and
       the correction is complete as it stands. What is not allowed is the
       other case: an unpriced column that does move work, where dropping it
       silently leaves the priced column to explain that work too. The
       threshold is the one from gate 3, so a column too small to be worth
       pricing is also too small to block on.
    2. A price is the marginal cost of one more unit of that column's work and
       cannot be below zero -- doing more does not take less time. A negative
       one means the fit is not describing the hardware, usually a mismeasured
       uniform batch, which is the subtrahend of every label in the cell.
