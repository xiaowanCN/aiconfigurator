"""Calibration-batch planning for the intra-batch prefill work delta.

A forward-pass estimate prices a prefill batch from its per-request means, so
two batches with the same totals and different spreads get the same number.
They do not cost the same: attention work is quadratic in the new-token count,
and a sparse indexer's cost depends on which requests sit above its top-k.
Measuring that difference needs batches built on purpose, because natural
traffic offers only one imbalance ratio per shape and the resulting equations
are parallel.

Around one cell ``(b, s_bar, p_bar)`` the batches hold both conserved sums
exactly, ``N = b * s_bar`` and ``P = b * p_bar``, so the label

    y = T_batch - T_uniform

cancels every term that depends on the totals alone and leaves the cost of the
spread.

Two prices, grouped by the GEOMETRY the work follows rather than by which
kernel runs it:

    y = c_idx * x_idx  +  c_mla * x_mla

``x_idx`` counts the trapezoid ``s*p + s^2/2`` -- the candidate scoring a
request presents to the indexer -- and ``x_mla`` counts the attention pairs
actually read, which the index budget caps at ``topk`` per query. Two shapes,
two prices.

An earlier revision split the attention column by kernel path, capped and
uncapped, on the theory that a capped read and an uncapped one are different
kernels at different rates. They are, but they are not separately
identifiable: both count attention pairs, so under the conserved totals a
batch that moves a row from one path to the other moves both columns in
lockstep. Across the measured grid the two sat at 170-177 degrees, and only
their sum was ever determined.

WHICH ROWS ENTER ``x_idx``. Only rows above the bound, and this is a
deliberate choice rather than a claim about the hardware. vLLM's indexer has
no short-circuit -- every request scores its whole sequence, whatever its
length -- so the physically literal column would include the short rows too.
It is not used, because a pure unsaturated segment cannot then isolate
anything: within it, indexer work and attention work are the SAME trapezoid,
so the two columns are exactly collinear and only their sum is determined.

So the basis is the one the segments can actually resolve:

    c_idx   the cost of a row that crosses topk, over and above what the same
            row would have cost staying below it
    c_mla   the whole cost of a row that stays below topk -- its attention AND
            its indexer scan, which no measurement here can separate

Naming ``c_idx`` after the indexer is therefore shorthand: it is the price of
crossing the bound, not the price of running the indexer. Short rows are not
free of indexer work; their indexer work is inside ``c_mla``.

Which column a segment can move follows from the regime, and that is what lets
one segment pin one price without a joint fit:

    pure saturated    every row is above topk, so the attention term is linear
                      in s and its deviation cancels exactly -- only x_idx
                      survives.
    pure unsaturated  no row crosses the bound, so x_idx is identically zero
                      by the definition above -- only x_mla survives.
    mixed             both are live, and the cell's pure segment has already
                      fixed one, so the rungs close the other with a degree of
                      freedom left over.

Each cell owns both of its prices. An earlier revision fitted ``c_mla`` once
across the unsaturated cells and handed it to the rest as a known constant, on
the theory that it is a property of the dense kernel rather than of an average
point. Measurement did not support that: the ratio varies by orders of
magnitude between cells, because at a cell whose average request is long the
dense column tops out at ``(b - 1) * topk^2 / 2`` while the cell's own work
grows with ``s_bar^2``, so the same nominal price buys a very different share
of the step. Solving it where it is used costs one rung and removes a
cross-cell dependency.

    whichever columns that uniform batch itself occupies -- decided by the
    average point's own length, not by this batch's regime.

    Short rows run the indexer too (see :func:`idx_work`), and they are still
