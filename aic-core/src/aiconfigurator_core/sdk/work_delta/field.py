"""Coefficient lookup for a query that lands between calibrated cells.

Calibration fits one cell at a time; deployment asks about batch sizes nobody
measured. This module is the bridge, and it is deliberately narrow: a query is
answered from the cell's own fit, or from two fits that bracket it along the
batch-size axis, or not at all.

Why only that axis, and the reason is structural rather than statistical.
Moving along ``b`` holds ``avg_s + avg_p``, so every request keeps its kernel
path and the cell goes on expressing the same regimes -- the two ends are
answering the same question, and only the parallelism between them differs.
Moving along ``avg_s`` lets a row cross ``topk``, so the far end may not even
express the regime the near end was calibrated in, and blending them averages
two different questions.

Not a claim that the prices vary less along ``b``. Measured, they do not: at
``avg_s=4096 avg_p=1024`` ``c_mla`` spans 20.7x across the batch sizes, while
along ``avg_s`` at fixed ``b`` it spans 1.8-2.4x. Cells run at different MFU and
a spread in the prices is expected either way. What the batch-size axis buys is
that the two ends are commensurable, not that they are close.

Why nothing weaker than bracketing. Earlier revisions fell back to single-ended
extrapolation and then to inverse-distance weighting over the whole field, so
that every query got an answer. Every point those two levels made worse -- 5 of
43 corrections in one run, 9 of 66 in the other, the worst turning a 0.30%
estimate into 11.50% -- came from them, and the points they damaged had errors
of 0.1-2.5% to begin with: batches that were already fine. Declining to answer
returns the caller to the uniform estimate, which is a known baseline. Answering
badly is undetectable in production.
