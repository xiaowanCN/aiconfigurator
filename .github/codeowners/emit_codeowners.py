"""Emit a GitHub CODEOWNERS file from areas.yaml.

GitHub CODEOWNERS is last-match-wins. The base tier is emitted by rendering
each area's declared ``path_globs`` verbatim as anchored rules, grouped per
area for readability, with cross-area carve-outs (a glob that lexically nests
under another area's dir glob) pulled into a trailing override section. Shared
co-ownership and file-type co-ownership are emitted LAST so they win over the
base rules they refine.

Emission is a PURE FUNCTION of the policy inputs (``areas.yaml`` and
``external_contributors.yaml``): the repository tree is NEVER read at emit
time. That fixes a base-branch race the old generator suffered from -- the
tree-dependent minimal-cover / singleton-file optimization used to rewrite
rules whenever an unrelated commit on ``main`` added, deleted, or moved a file
under an already-owned prefix, breaking the ``codeowners`` CI check on
long-running PRs that had touched nothing structural.

Coverage is still validated by ``build_codeowners.py --strict`` (which does
read ``git ls-files``). Emit and gate share ``codeowners_match``'s pure
resolver, so a tree file that the gate accepts also gets a rule at emit.

Nobody reads this file to find a reviewer -- GitHub auto-requests the owning
team, and ``who_owns.py`` answers "who reviews this path" on demand. The
grouping + legend just make the generated artifact navigable.

External contributors (``external_contributors.yaml``) attach to an area LABEL
and are appended as co-owners on every line that area's team owns, so they
inherit the team's globs without duplicating them. The same file drives
``CONTRIBUTORS.md``.

Usage:
  uv run python .github/codeowners/emit_codeowners.py \\
      --areas .github/codeowners/areas.yaml \\
      --out CODEOWNERS \\
      --external .github/codeowners/external_contributors.yaml \\
      --contributors-out CONTRIBUTORS.md
